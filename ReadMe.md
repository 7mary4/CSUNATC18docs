The content of this repository is mainly contained in its wiki:\
<http://GitHub.com/JamalMazrui/CSUNATC18docs/wiki>

Note that this is not an official project of the [CSUN Assistive Technology Conference](http://www.csunconference.org).  It does use a variant of the #CSUNATC18 hashtag from Twitter.

## Background

As a blind attendee of the 2018 CSUN conference, I found myself regularly in the position of not being able to follow a slide presentation in a session.  If the speaker gave a URL for a digital copy of the presentation, it was also not accessible to me because it was either just written on the final slide or the verbalized URL was too difficult to memorize through listening alone.

This project is an attempt to make the conference slides or handouts available in a manner that is relatively easy for speakers to share accessibly.  I investigated various alternatives for a free, reliable, and self-service system for sharing such documents, and on balance, an approach using GitHub features seemed to work best.  Given the popularity of GitHub in the tech world, many CSUN conference participants are already familiar with it.  Speakers, who often are developers, are likely to have an account already, so uploading a document or posting a link there should be a straightforward way to share.

## Sharing Steps

A CSUN speaker may share a conference document as a link on the wiki of the "CSUNATC18docs" repository, which is configured to permit contributions by anyone with a GitHub account.  If the speaker does not have use of another website for hosting the document, it may be uploaded in the issue queue of the same repository.  The following steps may be taken:

- Sign into the web site <http://www.github.com>.

- Go to the repository at <http://GitHub.com/JamalMazrui/CSUNATC18docs> (either a mixed case or lower case URL will work).

- Choose the "Wiki" link and then the "New Page link.  Alternatively, open the page <http://GitHub.com/JamalMazrui/CSUNATC18docs/wiki/new>.

- In the web form for creating a new page, use the "Title" field for inputting the title of the document to be shared.  Use the multi-line "Page content" field for a description that at least contains a link to the document.  By default, the wiki accepts Markdown syntax as input, so the link may be entered like this:

  `[Link name](Link URL)`

  It is recommended that each document include explicit licensing terms within its content, e.g., by referencing [Creative Commons — Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).

- If the document is not already hosted elsewhere, it may first be uploaded to the issue queue of the `CSUNATC18docs` repository before creating the wiki page (or it may be edited later to add the document URL).  To create an issue, open the page <http://GitHub.com/JamalMazrui/CSUNATC18docs/issues/new>.

- In the web form for creating a new page, use the "Title" field for inputting the title of the document to be shared.  Use the multi-line "Comment" field for any description.  Use the button for uploading a document as an attachment to the comment.

- After creating the issue, move focus to the attachment link and copy its full URL to the clipboard using the context menu (e.g., invoked via right click or Shift+F10).

- On a wiki page created for sharing the document, paste the URL when adding the link.

- The repository contains a test example of a wiki page that links to an issue attachment.

## Miscellaneous

If CSUN speakers participate by sharing in this manner, then their digital learning aids will be available to benefit anyone interested.  This will help to spread education about accessibility and further its implementation.

This project is an experiment in a self-service system based on professional trust.  Please post document links only if you were a speaker at the 2018 [CSUN Assistive Technology Conference](http://csunconference.org).

Feel free to use (responsibly) other collaboration features of the `CSUNATC18docs` repository, e.g., cloning it or adding  related material.
