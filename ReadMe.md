This is not an official project of the [CSUN Assistive Technology Conference](http://www.csunconference.org].

As a blind attendee of the 2018 conference, I found myself regularly in the position of not being able to follow a slide presentation in a session.  Even worse, if the speaker gave a web address for a digital copy of the presentation, this was also not accessible to me, as it was usually Although the speaker sometimes gives a web address for a digital copy of the presentation, that information was also not accessible to me since it was either just printed on the final slide or the spoken address was too difficult to memorize through listening.

This repository is an attempt to make slide presentations available in an accessible, coordinated manner.  Many conference attendees are already familiar with the github.com website.  Conference speakers are likely to have an account already so uploading a document would not be difficult.  Various alternatives were investigated for a free, reliable, and self-service system for sharing documents presented in conference sessions, and, on balance, this approach seemed to work best at this time.


To share a document related to the conference, sign into github.com and open the page [CSUNATC2018](https://github.com/jamalmazrui/csunatc2018).  Then choose "Issues" and "New" to add an issue with a title, comment, and attachment of the document to be shared.
